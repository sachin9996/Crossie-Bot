7/11/17, 1:40 PM - Rakesh Vakr: This "bit of" indicator is always shady. I've never seen it being used for anything but first letter.
7/11/17, 1:40 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Can it be used for something else from the operated word?
7/11/17, 1:41 PM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: I don't understand the question
7/11/17, 1:41 PM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: But I shall respond to it

7/11/17, 1:42 PM - Rakesh Vakr: No
7/11/17, 1:42 PM - Sukruth Koundinya: He's asking if it can be indicator for more than just the first letter
7/11/17, 1:43 PM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: No
7/11/17, 1:43 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Bit of "effort" being "f" or "ef" or something?
Can work given the rest of the surface gives enough context.
7/11/17, 1:43 PM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: That would be random
7/11/17, 1:43 PM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: You would have to quantify it
7/11/17, 1:43 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Right.

8/23/17, 11:33 PM - Gokul Nair: And if you look closely I just gave away the answer. :P
8/24/17, 12:02 AM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: Hidden word can't start at the beginning of a word ra

8/24/17, 1:09 AM - Gokul Nair: 10 is also included.
8/24/17, 1:09 AM - Gokul Nair: So technically not beginning.
8/24/17, 11:26 AM - Rakesh Vakr: Don't think it's legit
8/24/17, 11:53 AM - Gokul Nair: Arguable, I suppose, but let's move on.
8/24/17, 11:53 AM - Gokul Nair: .
8/24/17, 12:00 PM - Gokul Nair: Tbh, I found this one in a crossie book üò¨, but that had other clues which we'd consider non kosher as well, so.
8/24/17, 1:21 PM - Sanjana Paraz: Vile?
8/24/17, 1:25 PM - Gokul Nair: I was looking for Bane, double def.
8/24/17, 1:52 PM - Sanjana Paraz: I thought evil/vile
8/24/17, 1:53 PM - Gokul Nair: How would you anno that?
8/24/17, 1:58 PM - Sanjana Paraz: Villain is evil so destructive is anagram indicator
8/24/17, 1:58 PM - Sanjana Paraz: So vile
8/24/17, 1:58 PM - Sanjana Paraz: Also means destructive
8/24/17, 1:58 PM - Kaushik Vishwanath: Sweg

8/24/17, 1:59 PM - Gokul Nair: Too good, @917358284077 üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
8/24/17, 1:59 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Double duty and IA
8/24/17, 2:00 PM - Gokul Nair: Yeah, as def can't be indicator.
8/24/17, 2:00 PM - Gokul Nair: Does Bane work?
8/24/17, 2:01 PM - Kaushik Vishwanath: Idk how
8/24/17, 2:06 PM - Rakesh Vakr: If bane can be an adjective, yes
8/24/17, 2:07 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Which it's not(?) so no, I guess
8/24/17, 2:08 PM - Gokul Nair: Doesn't match with destructive?
8/24/17, 2:09 PM - Gokul Nair: Destruction of a Villain (4)
8/24/17, 2:10 PM - Gokul Nair: What about this? ‚òùüèº
8/24/17, 2:12 PM - Bhargavi Suryanarayanan: noun: bane; plural noun: banes
1. a cause of great distress or annoyance.

8/24/17, 2:12 PM - Kaushik Vishwanath: Yeah
8/24/17, 2:13 PM - Kaushik Vishwanath: Borg in da scene
8/24/17, 2:14 PM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: It feels like a 1.5 def. Because the villain is named for the quality. There's no two distinct meanings

8/24/17, 2:14 PM - Ranjani Srinivasan: üî•üî•üî•

8/26/17, 12:10 PM - Gokul Nair: You're welcome for the free publicity we gave WGC.
8/26/17, 12:10 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Question 
How much of insti scrabble held by WGC is actually the game on board, like versus or sth?
8/26/17, 12:11 PM - Advaith Jayakumar: The finals is always on a board.
8/26/17, 12:12 PM - Vikram Venkat: Prelims usually is written. A given state of a Scrabble board, with a few letters that you can choose from to make a word- somewhat like chess puzzles.
8/26/17, 12:12 PM - Vikram Venkat: Unless it has changed?
8/26/17, 12:13 PM - Advaith Jayakumar: No, it hasn't, unless kaushik has a better idea (hoping that's true)
8/26/17, 12:14 PM - Kaushik Vishwanath: STFW
8/26/17, 12:14 PM - Kaushik Vishwanath: STFU
8/26/17, 12:14 PM - Kaushik Vishwanath: What is this about?
8/26/17, 12:15 PM - Gokul Nair: Scrabble bro
8/26/17, 12:16 PM - Kaushik Vishwanath: Whats the "no it hasn't" for
8/26/17, 12:16 PM - Rakesh Vakr: +1 for parentheses content
8/26/17, 12:16 PM - Gokul Nair: Scrabble format
8/26/17, 12:16 PM - Vikram Venkat: Whether Scrabble prelims have changed their format
8/26/17, 12:17 PM - Kaushik Vishwanath: Sorry, didn't notice the question
8/26/17, 12:17 PM - Kaushik Vishwanath: Too noob right now to consider a change in format
8/26/17, 12:17 PM - Kaushik Vishwanath: But I hope we'll have new ideas by the end of this semester
8/26/17, 1:49 PM - Rakesh Vakr: How about an insti scrabble tournament like thingamajig instead? Early rounds can be played online or ofc. Later rounds face to face. It would make it more about the game itself than solving random sets of scenarios on paper like some exam. 

Forgib for any plebness in idea, I have barely any scrabble experience.
8/26/17, 1:49 PM - Rakesh Vakr: @919790469375 @917358284077
8/26/17, 1:50 PM - Kaushik Vishwanath: It's too lengthy a format
8/26/17, 1:50 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Will need scrabble to become more popular though, which must gather mass this semester itself.
8/26/17, 1:50 PM - Kaushik Vishwanath: From what I've heard
8/26/17, 1:51 PM - Kaushik Vishwanath: So we'll begin with scenarios, at least with our posts and sessions
8/26/17, 1:51 PM - Rakesh Vakr: It can be cut down. We managed a FIFA tourney itself over 2 days and we had shit tons of participants.
8/26/17, 1:52 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Early rounds can happen online itself (not at a venue), building up to the event.
8/26/17, 1:52 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Yes ofc
8/26/17, 1:54 PM - Vikram Venkat: Public affection for FIFA is very different from public affection for Scrabble
8/26/17, 1:55 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Yeah, which is why this is necessary^
8/26/17, 1:55 PM - Rakesh Vakr: If not, prelims should be an examesque thingy wonly XD
8/26/17, 1:56 PM - Vikram Venkat: It will reduce the number of participants to only those who are super enthu. Why would we want to turn away people by making it less interesting/more difficult?
8/26/17, 1:57 PM - Vikram Venkat: People won't like a long event, imo
8/26/17, 2:38 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Yes, but the early rounds/group stages (lol) happen online, so they can do it from the comfort of their rooms right? Likelihood is that the ones good/exp at it would qualify for the on ground round, so they are pretty likely not to be put off by the stretch.
Appropriate structuring of the event - done after registrations via a form - can help optimise on efficiency in the way it is conducted. Nonetheless, nothing can be conclusively said without seeing how the scene develops over the next sem. Very subject.
8/26/17, 2:39 PM - Rakesh Vakr: BTW, @setters of online WTGW, amaze shiz üëè loved it
8/26/17, 2:41 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99413 89689‚Ä¨: Yeah the questions are good
8/26/17, 2:47 PM - Zainab Ummer Farook: +1 and üç™üç™üç™üç™üç™
8/26/17, 2:57 PM - Vikram Venkat: Yeah. Very subjective. The "draw" needs to be done properly, for starters. Need to account for withdrawals. Need to manage times even for an online round- say you and i against a Freshie team (HS+ Civil) would be a nightmare to align times for all 4 participants. And a few times over unless you go Knockout all through.
8/26/17, 5:12 PM - ‚Ä™+91 96635 22865‚Ä¨: +1 and the Tom's puns were my favourite new type of questions.

*Normal Human*: People who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
*Shashi Tharoor*: Individuals who make their abodes in vitreous edifices would be advised to refrain from catapulting perilous projectiles.

*Normal Human*: Twinkle, twinkle, little star...
*Shashi Tharoor*: Scintillate, scintillate, asteroid minim.

*Normal Human*: All that glitters is not gold.
*Shashi Tharoor*: All articles that coruscate with resplendence are not truly auriferous.

*Normal Human*: Beggars are not choosers.
*Shashi Tharoor*: Sorting on the part of mendicants must be interdicted.

*Normal Human*: Dead men tell no tales.
*Shashi Tharoor*: Male cadavers are incapable of rendering any testimony.

*Normal Human*: Beginner's luck.
*Shashi Tharoor*: Neophyte's serendipity.

*Normal Human*: Birds of a feather flock together.
*Shashi Tharoor*: Members of an avian species of identical plumage tend to congregate.

*Normal Human*: Beauty is only skin deep.
*Shashi Tharoor*: Pulchritude possesses solely cutaneous profundity.

*Normal Human*: Cleanliness is godliness.
*Shashi Tharoor*: Freedom from incrustations of grime is contiguous to rectitude.

*Normal Human*: There's no use crying over spilt milk.
*Shashi Tharoor*: It is fruitless to become lachrymose of precipitately departed lactile fluid.

*Normal Human*: You can't try to teach an old dog new tricks.
*Shashi Tharoor*: It is fruitless to attempt to indoctrinate a superannuated canine with innovative maneuvers.

*Normal Human*: Look before you leap.
*Shashi Tharoor:* Surveillance should precede saltation.

*Normal Human*: He who laughs last, laughs best.
*Shashi Tharoor*: The person presenting the ultimate cachinnation possesses thereby the optimal cachinnation.

*Normal Human*: All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
*Shashi Tharoor*: Exclusive dedication to necessitous chores without interludes of hedonistic diversion renders Jack a hebetudinous fellow.

*Normal Human*: Where there's smoke, there's fire!
*Shashi Tharoor*: Where there are visible vapours having their provenance in ignited carbonaceous materials, there is conflagration.

10/12/17, 11:02 AM - Advaith Jayakumar: I thought a hand is a man
10/12/17, 11:04 AM - Bhargavi Suryanarayanan: Yeah. Redundant to have yard + man as the charade unless you have a diff def of man in the charade
10/12/17, 11:04 AM - Bhargavi Suryanarayanan: Wait am I explaining properly?
10/12/17, 11:05 AM - Rakesh Vakr: neh
10/12/17, 11:05 AM - Advaith Jayakumar: Makes sense, but part charade isn't allowed?
10/12/17, 11:06 AM - Rakesh Vakr: dafuq is a part charade
10/12/17, 11:08 AM - Bhargavi Suryanarayanan: It's like setting a clue that is shrewd + est = shrewdest
10/12/17, 11:09 AM - Bhargavi Suryanarayanan: It's not satisfying coz you're repeating the same word twice, in the part and the whole. Does that make sense?
10/12/17, 11:12 AM - Rakesh Vakr: Aah
I think the clue works, but is just a bad clue
10/12/17, 11:12 AM - Rakesh Vakr: Like an unelegant one
10/12/17, 11:12 AM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: It's not satisfying, yes.

10/12/17, 11:13 AM - Bhargavi Suryanarayanan: It is ah. I thought they were strict abt this sorta thing
10/12/17, 11:13 AM - Bhargavi Suryanarayanan: Only oldies like gridman get away with it no
10/12/17, 11:14 AM - Bhargavi Suryanarayanan: And neyartha?
10/12/17, 11:14 AM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: Yeah
10/12/17, 11:14 AM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: What if you're implying a different sense of the word in the surface?
10/12/17, 11:15 AM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: a la
10/12/17, 11:15 AM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: The Guardian does this. One word is clued straight away, but I think in a different sense of the word. But sometimes not satisfying enough.
10/12/17, 11:16 AM - Rakesh Vakr: Neyartha just adds filler words (not even linking words) all over the place without giving two shites about surface
10/12/17, 11:20 AM - Rakesh Vakr: I remember a Neyartha clue from a couple of years back. The answer was TAKTAK, and the def was "tapping noise"
I facepalmed so hard I knocked myself out
Midger boi remember this TAKTAK?
10/12/17, 11:25 AM - Bhargavi Suryanarayanan: Right. Fair enough
10/12/17, 11:26 AM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: Just to clarify, I wasn't defending that clue.
10/12/17, 11:26 AM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: Vaguely
10/12/17, 11:27 AM - Bhargavi Suryanarayanan: Are the meanings of hand sufficiently different in this case? Men are called hands because they work with their hands no?
10/12/17, 11:28 AM - Rakesh Vakr: Vile, rat-eating, rabid hyena can't set decent clues (8)

lel
10/12/17, 11:28 AM - Bhargavi Suryanarayanan: How else would you define taktak. Or do you mean why was taktak even there in the grid?
10/12/17, 11:29 AM - Bhargavi Suryanarayanan: Lol this is giving me flashbacks to Indian and western Phil classes. What is the essence of a gavagai?
10/12/17, 11:29 AM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: They're not. It's an inelegant clue
10/12/17, 11:30 AM - Rakesh Vakr: Latter lel

I attended the Crossie Fundae Session in my first year (seems there are photos of the session and yes, you could spot me in a couple of them :P) and have been a passive observant on the Facebook Page since then. 

Today, when all of us were dozing off in a rather boring lab class, @919790773336 lifted everyone's spirits by giving a couple of clues to chew upon from the discussions in this group. Got triggered. :D

Hoping to get more experience through the exchanges on this group. Maybe soon I'll be able to contribute too!

P.S: Thanks for the hearty welcome. XD

3/14/18, 10:08 AM - Shiraz Khan: But then
Vector space is an example of a field. Fields aren't examples of vector spaces

3/17/18, 7:20 PM - Abhijit Gupta: Maybelline?
3/17/18, 7:20 PM - Abhijit Gupta: But it isn't 7,4
3/17/18, 7:20 PM - Abhijit Gupta: Oh lol didn't see above stuff.
3/17/18, 7:20 PM - Rakesh Vakr: So it is wrong d-:
3/17/18, 7:20 PM - Shreya Harita: Fashion line?
3/17/18, 7:21 PM - Abhijit Gupta: Yeah yeah, noob here. :P
3/17/18, 7:21 PM - Rakesh Vakr: "Maybe" is redundant
3/17/18, 7:21 PM - Sachin Sridhar: Nah anagrind
3/17/18, 7:21 PM - Smrithi Sundar: Take it
3/17/18, 7:21 PM - Smrithi Sundar: Reverse anagram
3/17/18, 7:21 PM - Sachin Sridhar: Ah nice
3/17/18, 7:21 PM - Smrithi Sundar: Fashioning line gives you neil
3/17/18, 7:22 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Exactly why "Maybe" is redundant
3/17/18, 7:22 PM - Shreya Harita: Yeah that was confusing
3/17/18, 7:22 PM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: Maybe Neil = fashion line da
3/17/18, 7:22 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Neil is fashion line too
3/17/18, 7:22 PM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: Yeah but this works too
3/17/18, 7:23 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Maybe is a mislead that makes the clue inconsistent methinks
3/17/18, 7:23 PM - Shiraz Khan: No da kums
How to get Neil = fashion line
In Maybe Neil maybe is redundant
3/17/18, 7:23 PM - Rakesh Vakr: In this case ofc
3/17/18, 7:23 PM - Shreya Harita: I don't get this, wutt
3/17/18, 7:23 PM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: üòÖüòÖ
3/17/18, 7:24 PM - Rakesh Vakr: +1 hehe
3/17/18, 7:24 PM - Shreya Harita: 3 hi funda 5 me, sorry
3/17/18, 7:25 PM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: Nvm I didn't think it was redundant so... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
3/17/18, 7:25 PM - Smrithi Sundar: I added the maybe for surface
3/17/18, 7:25 PM - Smrithi Sundar: You can anagram line as many ways as you want
3/17/18, 7:25 PM - Smrithi Sundar: Neil is one of those
3/17/18, 7:26 PM - Rakesh Vakr: It doesn't really have a solid function as such
3/17/18, 7:26 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Ayyy üòÇ
3/17/18, 7:26 PM - Sachin Sridhar: Not every word has to no? Or so I thought
3/17/18, 7:26 PM - Rakesh Vakr: It should!
3/17/18, 7:27 PM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: Minimal words
3/17/18, 7:27 PM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: Some connectors are okay
3/17/18, 7:27 PM - Sachin Sridhar: Yeah? I'm pretty sure prepositions and stuff are allowed
3/17/18, 7:27 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Every section of the clue must connect, or at the least fill
3/17/18, 7:27 PM - Sachin Sridhar: Ah okay
3/17/18, 7:27 PM - Shiraz Khan: I think Shash usually insists cluing it as _how to get Neil_
3/17/18, 7:27 PM - Rakesh Vakr: To fill. Maybe isn't even doing that.
3/17/18, 7:27 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Verlevel
3/17/18, 7:27 PM - Shiraz Khan: Yeah but they usually make sense as connectors

_definition_ from _wordplay_

From would be superfluous
3/17/18, 7:27 PM - Shiraz Khan: Ofcourse, a lot of us pack this rule also
3/17/18, 7:28 PM - Shiraz Khan: Or
_wordplay_ to get _definition_
3/17/18, 7:29 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Fillers (different from connectors) are just words that do not indicate connection between the other sectors of the clue. But are just added to make the surface sound not retarded. Which makes it less elegant.
3/17/18, 7:30 PM - Rakesh Vakr: This is a third case. A word chumma being there, not having any funtion but to mislead (in the wrong way).
3/17/18, 7:37 PM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: My thoughts too
3/17/18, 7:38 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Yeah. So, redundant, cos "fashion" is doing that only.
3/17/18, 7:39 PM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: +1 memory

That may look like a way of saving money, but when you add the price of a baseball cap to hide your shiny globe, you are worse off.   Perhaps it is a pleasure for you.  But you sit motionless in a chair for eternity, choked out of your breath with an apron, while a stranger twists your neck left and right, yanks it backward and forward, pulls your hair with a pair of blunt scissors, and makes deep cuts in your skin with an electric clipper. That fits perfectly in my definition of ‚Äòtorture‚Äô.  You have to listen to the political commentary, football advice, and town gossip without protesting no matter how much you disagree.  What happened to the constitutional rights of those who get haircuts?"

3/30/18, 2:48 PM - ‚Ä™+91 98404 02685‚Ä¨: Is this something like (asparagus-gus)*
3/30/18, 2:48 PM - Smrithi Sundar: It was already solved da
3/30/18, 2:48 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: Shouldn't you drop asp
3/30/18, 2:48 PM - Smrithi Sundar: Sugarcane - Sug
3/30/18, 2:48 PM - Smrithi Sundar: = arcane
3/30/18, 2:48 PM - Advaith Jayakumar: Wtf
3/30/18, 2:49 PM - ‚Ä™+91 98404 02685‚Ä¨: Oh shit sry
3/30/18, 2:49 PM - Smrithi Sundar: First letters of Some Unnecessary Growth
3/30/18, 2:49 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: Dei I meant if it was asparagus then drop asp
3/30/18, 2:49 PM - Advaith Jayakumar: No
3/30/18, 2:49 PM - Advaith Jayakumar: Should drop sug regardless
3/30/18, 2:50 PM - Advaith Jayakumar: Wtf da
3/30/18, 2:52 PM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: Nope. Made it for litsoc. I'll see if I can find it
3/30/18, 3:11 PM - Shiraz Khan: Shashwat typing for days
3/30/18, 3:11 PM - Shiraz Khan: Woz he typing
3/30/18, 3:11 PM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: There were a handful though, I think. 
Kurian, SFM, Akshay Krishna, Nirmal, perhaps Aparna Suresh Sr. (don't remember). 
Although it's worth noting that these stats are for litsoc, back when hostel feel was strong enough for even semi-enthu people to throng litsoc events. 2014 Wtgw had a full CRC ground floor room with a decent number of "qc people" (Kevin, Nippo, etc.)
3/30/18, 3:12 PM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: I stopped for lunch
3/30/18, 3:13 PM - Vikram Venkat: Kurian was not QC no? And SFM not WGC
3/30/18, 3:13 PM - Vikram Venkat: Aparnna neither!
3/30/18, 3:14 PM - Vikram Venkat: Clubs in general were not a big thing. Barring Freshie Quiz/ JaM/ WtGW and the obligatory Scrabble/ whatever fundae session, clubs didn't do much
3/30/18, 3:14 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: She showed up for quizzes for points if that counts
3/30/18, 3:14 PM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: Not sure about Kurian, but the others have made litsoc finals in both wgc and qc events.
3/30/18, 3:14 PM - Vikram Venkat: *Quiz. India Quiz
3/30/18, 3:14 PM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: Ah okay, scratch Aparnna also
3/30/18, 3:15 PM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: Did Nirmal show up for non-SpEnts
3/30/18, 3:15 PM - Vikram Venkat: That way there's overlap across any club. Silicon would have made the finals at Monoacting, JaM, some quiz (surely), some word games (surely)
3/30/18, 3:16 PM - Vikram Venkat: Don't remember. TLQ in my freshie year I think
3/30/18, 3:17 PM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: Hence the disclaimer. Litsoc events are not reliable for drawing any conclusions
3/30/18, 3:17 PM - Vikram Venkat: <Media omitted>
3/30/18, 3:18 PM - Vikram Venkat: LT put WGC points. Let that sink in for a bit.

3/30/18, 3:34 PM - Shiraz Khan: Narmad? That's not right. Ink I spilled in the hostel. (9)
3/30/18, 3:35 PM - Vikram Venkat: This clue is under water
3/30/18, 3:35 PM - Kaushik Vishwanath: There's a photo of Kass fishing there
3/30/18, 3:35 PM - Shiraz Khan: It's pretty deep. Give it a while to sink in

4/1/18, 11:00 AM - Shiraz Khan: Craze, ferril.
4/1/18, 11:00 AM - Shiraz Khan: 'player' could be dropped
4/1/18, 11:01 AM - Shiraz Khan: But surface would've been packed
4/1/18, 11:02 AM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: Nice!
4/1/18, 11:03 AM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: I've a noob question.
How is "perhaps" part of the anno?
4/1/18, 11:03 AM - Shiraz Khan: Because it's not an exact substitution. It's shady. So you add a 'perhaps' and hope people don't lynch
4/1/18, 11:04 AM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: Ah.
4/1/18, 11:04 AM - Shiraz Khan: Shashwat is typing a more elegant ELI5
4/1/18, 11:04 AM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: Because it's a quirky interpretation of the phrase. 
Because First person is being interpreted as self
4/1/18, 11:05 AM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: Sorry to disappoint
4/1/18, 11:05 AM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: Perhaps is basic elbow grease, yeah
4/1/18, 11:05 AM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: But tbh, that's what the wordplay is, isn't it?
4/1/18, 11:06 AM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: First person is self and also the FPS first person in its actual sense. 

Is that exactly a "shady" substitution?
4/1/18, 11:06 AM - Shiraz Khan: Yeah you wouldn't add perhaps for substitution with synonyms. Like dictionary synonyms, or crossie norms
4/1/18, 11:08 AM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: The phrase First person shooter as a whole is 'shooting from self's perspective' which has been interpreted as 'shooting self'
4/1/18, 11:09 AM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: In that sense you're cheating the convention, interpreting the phrase in a *different* way for the Wordplay. That's why perhaps.
4/1/18, 11:10 AM - Shiraz Khan: But note that you'd pack the perhaps if the clue itself is a cryptic definition.
4/1/18, 11:10 AM - Shiraz Khan: Egypt's flower (4)

Wouldn't add a perhaps for this, because the whole point of the clue is that it should be shady
4/1/18, 11:11 AM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: Makes sense, makes sense.
Thanks!
4/1/18, 11:12 AM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: Question mark recommended though

4/3/18, 2:35 AM - Shiraz Khan: But why 'cruciverbalist'?
4/3/18, 2:35 AM - Ferril Samal: cool clue
4/3/18, 2:35 AM - Zainab Ummer Farook: Oh that letter
4/3/18, 2:35 AM - Ferril Samal: he loves letters... triple def
4/3/18, 2:36 AM - Shiraz Khan: .......
Wow. Doesn't work exact, but still blows my mind
4/3/18, 2:36 AM - Zainab Ummer Farook: Pah. Deciphering god
4/3/18, 2:37 AM - Ferril Samal: zainab loves the word goddess... coz she is one
4/3/18, 2:37 AM - ‚Ä™+91 73580 33679‚Ä¨: someone's on cracking based on just def fire today :P
4/3/18, 2:38 AM - ‚Ä™+91 73580 33679‚Ä¨: ok this was post romantic + enum
4/3/18, 2:39 AM - Zainab Ummer Farook: Whyyy
4/3/18, 2:39 AM - Zainab Ummer Farook: Yeah lol
4/3/18, 2:39 AM - Ferril Samal: ask shiraz
4/3/18, 2:39 AM - Shreya Harita: does the "form" of the definition in the clue have to be the same as the answer? like noun/verb/adjective
4/3/18, 2:40 AM - Shiraz Khan: Nope. As long as they're spelt the same
4/3/18, 2:40 AM - Ferril Samal: .
4/3/18, 2:40 AM - Shreya Harita: oh. but the tense has to be the same is what someone said earlier?
4/3/18, 2:41 AM - Shiraz Khan: Yeah the tense does. If the spelling changes with tense
4/3/18, 2:41 AM - Shreya Harita: riiight. thanks
4/3/18, 2:41 AM - Zainab Ummer Farook: Also plurals
4/3/18, 2:41 AM - Zainab Ummer Farook: Those matter too
4/3/18, 2:41 AM - Shiraz Khan: For example the def for Shiraz should be Him, not His
And def for Letter should be Character
4/3/18, 2:41 AM - Shiraz Khan: Not characters
4/3/18, 2:42 AM - Shreya Harita: even if spelling doesn't change? eg) furniture answer. def chair/chairs. or the other way round.
4/3/18, 2:43 AM - Shiraz Khan: Which is why I said this
Cruciverbalist = letter lover, not love letter.
'As a cruciverbalist might' is a bit better.
4/3/18, 2:44 AM - Shiraz Khan: Hmm interesting example. Then it doesn't mater
4/3/18, 2:44 AM - Shreya Harita: ohh okay
4/3/18, 2:44 AM - Shreya Harita: right. thanks
4/3/18, 2:46 AM - Shiraz Khan: The tense can be used shadily in the clue
For example clue could be _Furniture are.._ (seems plural) but the answer could be Chair (singular)
4/3/18, 2:46 AM - Shreya Harita: ooh that type is allowed, okay.
4/3/18, 2:48 AM - Shiraz Khan: One of my favourite clues. One of the first cryptics I ever saw, too. Nirmal had some fundae session in SAC ~
4/3/18, 2:48 AM - Shiraz Khan: Eagles' descents (8)

4/3/18, 2:51 AM - Shiraz Khan: Modified clue to get with the times
4/3/18, 2:51 AM - Ferril Samal: nice

4/3/18, 2:54 AM - Ferril Samal: you can verify answer
4/3/18, 2:55 AM - Shiraz Khan: @919003132487 here descents sounds like decrease in height. But the answer can be descents as in pedigrees/ancestries. That's what I was trying to say.
4/3/18, 2:55 AM - ‚Ä™+91 90422 02521‚Ä¨: Cigarette only no?

Cryptic definition
4/3/18, 3:02 AM - Shiraz Khan: &lit would have both wordplay and definition. This just has a definition, albeit a sufficiently shady one
4/3/18, 3:03 AM - Zainab Ummer Farook: Ah okay
4/3/18, 3:06 AM - Ferril Samal: CDs are very hard to make... Shiz... what's method?
4/3/18, 3:06 AM - Ferril Samal: apart from pure inspiration
4/3/18, 3:07 AM - Shiraz Khan: Shash is good at it. You don't set out to make a CD, rather you look at a word and realise it has CD potential
4/3/18, 3:09 AM - Ferril Samal: You need balls to fire them? (7)

4/3/18, 8:53 AM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: Not intended as a triple def. It's a CD (almost a CD within a CD)

O for a cruciverbalist is the definition 
And post-romantic = one who romances through the post, is just there as an additional pun.

We tried not to break the definition, but it sort of works because it's a CD.

4/5/18, 10:17 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: Does every crossie clue have to have a def at the beginning or the end?
4/5/18, 10:17 PM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: Yes
4/5/18, 10:17 PM - Advaith Jayakumar: Yes
4/5/18, 10:17 PM - Smrithi Sundar: Yes
4/5/18, 10:17 PM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: Then there are &lits

4/5/18, 10:18 PM - Smrithi Sundar: So the entire clue is the def
4/5/18, 10:18 PM - Advaith Jayakumar: Entire clue works as def
4/5/18, 10:18 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: Are sole wordplay clues also legit?
4/5/18, 10:18 PM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: No ra
4/5/18, 10:18 PM - Advaith Jayakumar: Not really :P
4/5/18, 10:18 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: Aw damn

4/5/18, 10:19 PM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: But technically not legit
4/5/18, 10:19 PM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: Depends on the type of ckue
4/5/18, 10:19 PM - Advaith Jayakumar: Anagram fodder has to be in the clue, for example.
4/5/18, 10:20 PM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: Telescopic words have to be totally hidden
4/5/18, 10:20 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: What is an anagram fodder üòá

4/5/18, 10:20 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: Oh, that's what it sounds like but I thought it maybe meant something else xD
4/5/18, 10:20 PM - Advaith Jayakumar: What's partially hidden though
4/5/18, 10:21 PM - Smrithi Sundar: Anagrind -> anagram fodder -> answer -> success
4/5/18, 10:21 PM - Shiraz Khan: And it should be cryptic. You can't make straightforward clues
4/5/18, 10:21 PM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: End letter of hidden.word should not be end letter of fodder
4/5/18, 10:23 PM - Advaith Jayakumar: Oh like that

4/5/18, 11:28 PM - Smrithi Sundar: The anagram fodder (letters to be anagrammed) have to be present in the clue
4/5/18, 11:29 PM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: If not then it's an IA
4/5/18, 11:29 PM - Smrithi Sundar: You can't sub a word then anagram it

4/9/18, 7:10 PM - Shashwat Sinai Salgaocar: Lolol. You can't do that. Adding person changes the def from an adjective to a noun.

However, in this case you're bailed out by the fact that notable is also a noun. 
He's a notable = he's an important person.

4/9/18, 10:14 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Def in first clue was non living
4/9/18, 10:14 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: I think non living may have been a more correct def.
4/9/18, 10:14 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: Without the "thing" though, cuz thing shouldn't be part of the def technically
4/9/18, 10:15 PM - ‚Ä™+91 97910 25363‚Ä¨: yea
4/9/18, 10:15 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: Also, parts of speech must match üòÅ

4/9/18, 10:52 PM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: By a PhD student
4/9/18, 10:53 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: But apparently words of same root can't be used. So non living and life can't come in a cryptic clue.
4/9/18, 10:54 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Cuz confusion in def I guess

4/10/18, 11:51 AM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: Does "Last one removed from study" make sense per se?
Or is "study" just thrown in as the def?
4/10/18, 11:51 AM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: Def ra
4/10/18, 11:51 AM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: From is a connector
4/10/18, 11:52 AM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: So does "from" have a semantic role at all?
4/10/18, 11:52 AM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: Or is it just for the sake of grammatical correctness?
4/10/18, 11:54 AM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: Semantic aa
4/10/18, 11:54 AM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: It doesn't serve the clue if that's what you mean

4/10/18, 12:29 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: Torment is a def+HP indicator isn't it?
4/10/18, 12:29 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: That's allowed?
4/10/18, 12:31 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: Like it's an hp indicator after you've taken def.
4/10/18, 12:35 PM - Smrithi Sundar: Nope
4/10/18, 12:35 PM - Smrithi Sundar: Arsonist is the def
4/10/18, 12:35 PM - Smrithi Sundar: Torment = torture whose homophone is torcher
4/10/18, 12:38 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: Got this, but torment can be used when its synonym is the HP indicator and not the word itself?
4/10/18, 12:40 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: Score out "indicator" wherever I've used it. 
I misinterpreted indicator. I'm talking about the homophone itself.
4/10/18, 12:40 PM - Smrithi Sundar: I don't understand what you're asking da
4/10/18, 12:40 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: Okay wait üòÇ
4/10/18, 12:41 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: Torment itself isn't the homophone. Torture is. 

So torment can be used in the clue while, actually, torture is the actual homophone?
4/10/18, 12:41 PM - Smrithi Sundar: This is a legit clue. 
[Homophone of (Synonym of torment)] = [word that means arsonist]
4/10/18, 12:41 PM - Smrithi Sundar: I want to say yes?mm

Filler words are used to make the surface read better as a sentence or phrase in English, but don't particularly have functionality

Connecting words are great, filling words are nauseating

5/27/18, 6:09 PM - Ferril Samal: 'They' hides the complexity of the issue I believe... It generalises them... Each of them is unique... It's no different from grouping the entire LGBTQ community under one banner... labelling blurs out the granularity of what 'they' are facing... In the wise words of Nomi Watts... Labelling is the exact opposite of understanding... 's/he' is a constant reminder of the storm within them and societies instinct to bracket them in one or the other...They can be lie anywhere in the spectrum of the constructed ideas of 'she' and 'he'... Like all spectrums, only a part is visible to us... but it reminds us what we fail to see and understand...

5/27/18, 6:15 PM - Shreya Harita: Would you want to constantly remind them of the storm within them and societies' instinct to bracket them in either of s/she? Doesn't "they" capture the concept of the gender galaxy better, instead of polarizing it as a spectrum where "she" and "he" are more "normal" than the other? And doesn't introducing more pronouns just unfairly granularise the continuous nature of gender?
5/27/18, 6:15 PM - Sukruth Koundinya: But mama that last part. If it's true, isnt it a constant reminder for themselves also

6/7/18, 5:49 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: RA
6/7/18, 5:50 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: And tear*
6/7/18, 5:50 PM - ‚Ä™+91 98404 02685‚Ä¨: yeah got that
6/7/18, 5:50 PM - ‚Ä™+91 98404 02685‚Ä¨: where did wear come from?
6/7/18, 5:50 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Reverse anagram Da.
6/7/18, 5:50 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Wear is anagrind.
6/7/18, 5:50 PM - Rakesh Vakr: ```Intuition```
6/7/18, 5:50 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: üòÆ
6/7/18, 5:51 PM - ‚Ä™+91 98404 02685‚Ä¨: Thought crossie people were very specific about annos
6/7/18, 5:51 PM - ‚Ä™+91 98404 02685‚Ä¨: ok fine
6/7/18, 5:51 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Dei
6/7/18, 5:52 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Intuition was not the anno
6/7/18, 5:52 PM - ‚Ä™+91 98404 02685‚Ä¨: ik that da...
6/7/18, 5:52 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Then ?
6/7/18, 5:53 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: This is the problem with RA lol
6/7/18, 5:53 PM - ‚Ä™+91 98404 02685‚Ä¨: .
6/7/18, 5:53 PM - ‚Ä™+91 98404 02685‚Ä¨: Idk why RA is even a legit clue
6/7/18, 5:53 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: üôÉüôÇ
6/7/18, 5:53 PM - ‚Ä™+91 98404 02685‚Ä¨: But IA isn't
6/7/18, 5:53 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: Coz RA has parts of fodder in answer
6/7/18, 5:54 PM - ‚Ä™+91 98404 02685‚Ä¨: So if an IA has part of fodder, it's fine?
6/7/18, 5:54 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Yeah. There's def as well as part of fodder. Plus it's kinda funüò¨
6/7/18, 5:55 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: üòÆ
6/7/18, 5:55 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: But then in case of RA we know that the missing part is an anagrind.
6/7/18, 5:55 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: Idk da talk to these people
6/7/18, 5:55 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Not the case with IA
6/7/18, 5:56 PM - Rakesh Vakr: There are surface RA indicators
Like _shown by, perhaps, could be_ to show that something different is going on
But again, they aren't necessary
6/7/18, 5:56 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: Which as we know is almost any word in the dictionary
6/7/18, 5:56 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: üôà
6/7/18, 5:56 PM - ‚Ä™+91 98404 02685‚Ä¨: yeah, but you have to know all the anagrinds then. It's far easier to come up with a simple synonym and anagram it than to come up with the correct anagrind
6/7/18, 5:56 PM - ‚Ä™+91 98404 02685‚Ä¨: this adds to the prob
6/7/18, 5:56 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: For example, how is tear an angrind
6/7/18, 5:57 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: This message was deleted
6/7/18, 5:57 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Here wear is the anag no
6/7/18, 5:57 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: Yeah sorry
6/7/18, 5:57 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: How is wear an anag
6/7/18, 5:57 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: Wear means to put something on
6/7/18, 5:57 PM - Rakesh Vakr: ```Intuition```
6/7/18, 5:58 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Not that meaning
6/7/18, 5:58 PM - Smrithi Sundar: Wear and tear is a very Common idiom
6/7/18, 5:58 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Also means to erode.
6/7/18, 5:58 PM - Smrithi Sundar: Most RA's use universal idioms/phrases
6/7/18, 5:58 PM - Smrithi Sundar: Which make them easier to guess
6/7/18, 5:58 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: Erosion is not exactly an anagrind is it
6/7/18, 5:59 PM - ‚Ä™+91 98404 02685‚Ä¨: That's not a valid reason. I could make the same case for IAs
6/7/18, 5:59 PM - Smrithi Sundar: How lol
6/7/18, 5:59 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Umm it means to damage.
6/7/18, 5:59 PM - ‚Ä™+91 98404 02685‚Ä¨: wtf do you mean how xD. i'll just make the answer a well known phrase/idiom
6/7/18, 5:59 PM - Rakesh Vakr: RA is more consistent
RA is doable
IA clues cause a huge fissure between setter and solver, hence they are tabooed
6/7/18, 5:59 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Dude if you IA some word like eschew then how do we ever figure it out.
6/7/18, 5:59 PM - Smrithi Sundar: IA na you can use any word in the dictionary. Synonyms ae will be 10000
6/7/18, 6:00 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: How is damage anagrind then
6/7/18, 6:00 PM - Rakesh Vakr: ```Intuition```
6/7/18, 6:00 PM - Smrithi Sundar: I can find 5 letter words which mean the same
6/7/18, 6:00 PM - ‚Ä™+91 98404 02685‚Ä¨: Dei enna da solra
6/7/18, 6:00 PM - Smrithi Sundar: But it'll be a pain in the ass
6/7/18, 6:00 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Exactly
6/7/18, 6:01 PM - Smrithi Sundar: RA na fodder is there. Guess the anagrind. IA na only anagrind. Fodder is God knows what
6/7/18, 6:01 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Whatever I've typed out Da. What if you use some very complex word as fodder in IA form.
6/7/18, 6:01 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: Damage indicates loss of something . . .
6/7/18, 6:01 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Plus, if you are using multiple functions like a charade + IA, there are so many possible permutations possible
6/7/18, 6:01 PM - Smrithi Sundar: Which is easier? Getting fodder or guessing anagrind based on kneon idioms, phrases etc?
6/7/18, 6:01 PM - Sachin Sridhar: I'm sure you can find 10000 anagrinds if you try hard enough. Honestly it's just upto you/the setter/whatever where you draw the line
6/7/18, 6:01 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Scratch one possible
6/7/18, 6:01 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: It could mean 'not like the original version'
6/7/18, 6:01 PM - Smrithi Sundar: Damage is the def ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
Wear and tear means damage literally
6/7/18, 6:02 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Eh no
6/7/18, 6:02 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: No no this is from different context
6/7/18, 6:02 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Damage came up after a few levels of synonyms
6/7/18, 6:02 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Yeah lol
6/7/18, 6:02 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: How is wear an anagrind is what I had asked
6/7/18, 6:02 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Like a damaged wall could mean the bricks aren't in the same position as they were before.
6/7/18, 6:02 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: Also, damage doesn't mean a different version of something
6/7/18, 6:03 PM - Smrithi Sundar: Wear  something also Means erode/reduce/degrade
6/7/18, 6:03 PM - Sachin Sridhar: Wear ~ damage ~ rearrange

Whether or not you think that's good enough is a matter of opinion
6/7/18, 6:03 PM - Smrithi Sundar: +1
6/7/18, 6:03 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Bad phrasing pls pardon.
6/7/18, 6:03 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Also, RAs usually have a compound enum with a small surface
Biggest giveaway
And using enum, finding the fodder is easy
6/7/18, 6:03 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Thanks for better phrasing lol.
6/7/18, 6:03 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: Convention I guess.
6/7/18, 6:04 PM - Sachin Sridhar: True da, but we're arguing about the principle. "Enum makes it easier" isn't good enough a reason
6/7/18, 6:05 PM - Smrithi Sundar: He didn't say enum makes it easier. He said giveaway
6/7/18, 6:06 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: Also, is adding anagrind + anagramming the only wordplay in an RA
6/7/18, 6:06 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: ?
6/7/18, 6:06 PM - Sachin Sridhar: Can have &lit clues too no?
6/7/18, 6:06 PM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: That's the idea
6/7/18, 6:07 PM - Sachin Sridhar: But yeah largely I guess
6/7/18, 6:07 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Unless it's explicitly stated to be experimental
6/7/18, 6:07 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Like phi operation
6/7/18, 6:08 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: Idk da the rules aren't set in stone anywhere,
6/7/18, 6:08 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Or re:present
6/7/18, 6:08 PM - Giridhur Sriraman: Most of these apply to the Hindu/guardian crossword only
6/7/18, 6:08 PM - Sachin Sridhar: Kums explicitly told me that I need to have the letters "phi" in the clue
6/7/18, 6:08 PM - Sachin Sridhar: Else it's considered IA
6/7/18, 6:08 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: üòÇüòÇ
6/7/18, 6:08 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: IRA
6/7/18, 6:08 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: AIR
6/7/18, 6:09 PM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: That ^
6/7/18, 6:09 PM - Smrithi Sundar: Hip replacement for Greek character (3)
This is simple anagram. Will give phi.
On the other hand, 
Body part replacement for Greek character (3) makes it an IA
6/7/18, 6:09 PM - Ferril Samal: Swallowed to eat, maybe (3)
6/7/18, 6:09 PM - Ferril Samal: Drink and eat, maybe.(3)
6/7/18, 6:09 PM - Ferril Samal: Stir tea and consume.(3)
6/7/18, 6:09 PM - Ferril Samal: Tasted tea, maybe.(3)

6/7/18, 6:10 PM - Sachin Sridhar: Ferril > 600 clues by tonight
6/7/18, 6:10 PM - Rakesh Vakr: An IA is a charade+anagram

Each function in a clue should have only one layer
Multiple layers just makes it unsolvable and overly complex
The beauty of crossie is that it is well structured, as well as not restricted by boundaries
The former is the common "lingo" between the solver and setter (no double duty, one layer per function etc) whereas the latter is shown by the non extensive set of anagrinds, the dubiousness in an indicator (a containment indicator can also be a charade or an anagrind, subjective to the context etc)
6/7/18, 6:11 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: What this?
6/7/18, 6:11 PM - Ferril Samal: üòÖ
6/7/18, 6:11 PM - Smrithi Sundar: Chaya

6/7/18, 6:17 PM - Sachin Sridhar: My argument was not that RAs are evil and that IAs are not, it's that RAs aren't any better off then. Finding an anagrind that fits the clue (out of nothing) is just as bad, imho. RAs partially reverse the role between clue and answer, at least that's how I think of them
6/7/18, 6:17 PM - Sachin Sridhar: Although I wouldn't say no to this

6/9/18, 3:55 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Ah
6/9/18, 3:55 PM - Ferril Samal: Guys... I've known dhur for too long...He loves fights...he will keep fighting after knowing he is losing also...the trick is always to not continue the random argument... You shouldn't take arguments with him seriously because he is not serious... He's doing it for the lulz most of the time... He'll admit it also.

So I don't think he should be kicked out of the group for that reason... Because he's always been like this... Always... And we've been able to enjoy Dhur's presence on the group and at the same time surgically ignore his bullshit for huge part of this group's existence...
If he crossed certain lines that he shouldn't have with certain ppl...he should definitely sort with them...
But he should ideally be in the group for the same reason we are all here for... We all love wordgames...we all love crossie...We are all ambassadors of the craft...Sometimes with a pinch/heap of bullshit.
6/9/18, 3:55 PM - Ferril Samal: P.S. Do I have the longest message now?
6/9/18, 3:55 PM - Rakesh Vakr: How's "always been like this" an excuse for bad behaviour? Asking in general.
6/9/18, 3:55 PM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: Something tells me this was the intention :3
6/9/18, 3:57 PM - Vishwanath Guruvayurappan: Just wondering. Dhur is a really really smart guy. Maybe he thinks we all are not competent enough? We think he is arrogant?
6/9/18, 3:57 PM - Vishwanath Guruvayurappan: Okay will avoid
6/9/18, 3:58 PM - Smrithi Sundar: He comes off as mean and condescending. Especially to newbies.
6/9/18, 3:58 PM - Smrithi Sundar: My opinion might not count as I'm new here and I barely know him
6/9/18, 3:58 PM - Smrithi Sundar: But he gets personal
6/9/18, 3:58 PM - Smrithi Sundar: Something he shouldn't be knowing
6/9/18, 3:58 PM - Ferril Samal: It's not... I'm saying what has changed is that we are being affected by it now... He should sort it out with those he pissed off... We've made it clear as a group that we are unhappy with his treatment of ppl...
6/9/18, 3:58 PM - Rakesh Vakr: We can surgically ignore cos we know him da
It's not fair to expect others to
6/9/18, 4:01 PM - Vishwanath Guruvayurappan: Seniority counts.
6/9/18, 4:01 PM - Akhil Ashok: Kinda agree, I don't mind ignoring him. Don't know about others.
6/9/18, 4:02 PM - Vikram Venkat: All this being said, maybe we can add him back and see how it goes? He should know now why we were pained enough to remove him, and perhaps try to rectify what he is doing? Let's not kill his interest in word games at the same time

6/9/18, 4:03 PM - Ferril Samal: Which is why I wanted to give background on what kind of person he is... To tell ppl that he is not as bad as he seems... and with some getting used to...see him as value add... Now up to you guys to decide
6/9/18, 4:03 PM - Akhil Ashok: Omg
6/9/18, 4:03 PM - Ferril Samal: Exactly
6/9/18, 4:03 PM - Ferril Samal: üòÇüòÇ
6/9/18, 4:04 PM - Akhil Ashok: I'm all for including everyone.
6/9/18, 4:05 PM - Rakesh Vakr: True da
That changed because the group expanded to new people and all
Back then it was just us who knew each other so it was chill
Tbf I've been getting angry PMs from members for a long time. I resisted quite a bit hoping he'd stop at some point.

Remember when IITB convener left the grouop a couple of years ago cos some fuckas were squabbling? Can't risk the group getting repulsive for people, especially ones who are eagerly learning
6/9/18, 4:05 PM - Ferril Samal: On the contrary... Since you are New your opinion has more value akka...
6/9/18, 4:09 PM - Vikram Venkat: Can we add him back and highlight what we don't like - especially the new people who don't know him from before (as Ferril said, some of us know him longer and hence filter out a little more at least :P ). If he crosses the lines again, we can give him a little leeway, and then decide whether we want to remove him again
6/9/18, 4:10 PM - Rakesh Vakr: But the damage caused already begets a timeout at the least.
6/9/18, 4:11 PM - Vikram Venkat: I'm pretty sure he realizes that this step puts him in the same category as Abheek, and he won't be happy about that
6/9/18, 4:11 PM - Vikram Venkat: So the 6 hours itself would be a sort of punishment
6/9/18, 4:11 PM - Akhil Ashok: Lol. ü§£ü§£
6/9/18, 4:12 PM - Vishwanath Guruvayurappan: That isn't good.
6/9/18, 4:12 PM - Vikram Venkat: @newbies: Abheek is a batchmate of mine who is a jerk and was thrown out of the group apx last year
6/9/18, 4:12 PM - Rakesh Vakr: <Media omitted>
6/9/18, 4:12 PM - Vikram Venkat: Nearly _everyone_ hates Abheek
6/9/18, 4:13 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Yaaay I can vouch.

But otherwise, most succinct Abheek 101 I've seen.
6/9/18, 4:17 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Also I've not taken offence from anything Dhur says about me. But I think that's my basic nature. I don't take offence at all. @919445993351 pls vouch. But +1 to Dhur is mean to people.
6/9/18, 4:17 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Abheek actually left the group after he told us that he'll be "shagging all our wives" in 10 years lol.
But yeah, multiple kiccs prior to that.
6/9/18, 4:17 PM - Vishwanath Guruvayurappan: Who is this edgy boy?
6/9/18, 4:17 PM - Smrithi Sundar: Talk about self confidence

6/9/18, 4:17 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Yeah.
6/9/18, 4:19 PM - Zainab Ummer Farook: You lot stfu about newbie bias. You guys matter more than the rest of us, if the clubs have to go on. It's the seniors' jobs to make you feel comfortable, and if you don't, let us know without hesitation
6/9/18, 4:19 PM - Rakesh Vakr: +üî•
6/9/18, 4:19 PM - Zainab Ummer Farook: Pack disclaimers and all.
6/9/18, 4:20 PM - Unnikrishnan P, V: Also, why can't Dhur be like Shash or Vakr or Ferril it Shiraz or Kums and actually 'mentor' us, being a senior ?
6/9/18, 4:25 PM - Ferril Samal: Nice

- We might have to add someone else to the group (the bot) because it won't read messages if I've already read them on my phone.
- Might not get more than one clue per message, or clues that span multiple lines (working on this).

If things go wrong, I can always download the entire chat and filter clues and upload. This daily update thing is just experimental for now

6/10/18, 11:03 PM - Akhil Ashok: That doesn't work at all noü§î or is Spooner any random interchange
6/10/18, 11:04 PM - Akhil Ashok: Hwy
6/10/18, 11:04 PM - Sachin Sridhar: It's some phonetic interchange, doesn't have to be first letters/sounds tho, I think @919884184060 explained it here once a while ago
6/10/18, 11:05 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Spooners work with the phonetics
And regardless, the way you say it, why is it Ney mar and not neym ar?
6/10/18, 11:06 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Ok wait I confused myself
6/10/18, 11:06 PM - Akhil Ashok: Ney mar works with Mai nhour
Neym ar doesn't work with main hour i.e. Going by my previous logic

6/10/18, 11:09 PM - Vikram Venkat: Wut. Context pls
6/10/18, 11:09 PM - Vikram Venkat: Wait lemme read
6/10/18, 11:12 PM - Vikram Venkat: Okay I simply do not follow. But why this purity suddenly.
Spooners ideally, afaik, should be exchange of first syllables. ie Main hour will be ouain mar (or however you pronounce it). Tasted worms is wasted terms.
6/10/18, 11:12 PM - Vikram Venkat: But we've done all sorts of stuff on this group before
6/10/18, 11:13 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Ohho
Ok I'll try something unconventional
6/10/18, 11:15 PM - Vikram Venkat: Which is also why the cunning plan - punning clan I put last time is not pure. It's a letter exchange and not a syllable exchange
6/10/18, 11:16 PM - Akhil Ashok: Still on the acceptable boundary no
6/10/18, 11:17 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Not if you're exchanging letters that way
6/10/18, 11:17 PM - Vikram Venkat: Cla- is the syllable. Strictly, for it to work both ways, it is Punning Clan - Clunning Pan. Which makes _no sense_
6/10/18, 11:17 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Neymar spooners to main hour though
And the other way if you take it as one entity
6/10/18, 11:18 PM - Vikram Venkat: Also, pure spooners should ideally work both directions
6/10/18, 11:18 PM - Vikram Venkat: But again. WHY this sudden purity
6/10/18, 11:18 PM - Vikram Venkat: I saw a 3.429 clue cos it's 24/7 wut. (sorry, setter. No offense meant)
6/10/18, 11:18 PM - Akhil Ashok: Back to its main hour not Mai nhour.
6/10/18, 11:19 PM - Rakesh Vakr: Mainhour*
6/10/18, 11:20 PM - Vikram Venkat: Guys stop arguing. :P It's not the best spooner, but probably not the worst on the group
6/10/18, 11:20 PM - Akhil Ashok: Ok. Sorry. Bye.
6/10/18, 11:20 PM - Rakesh Vakr: I'll dissect and get to the bottom of this Spooner conundrum tho hehe

6/19/18, 3:48 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: Here it's the exchange of a consonant and an open vowel
6/19/18, 3:49 PM - Akhil Ashok: Be llo  ellbo
6/19/18, 3:49 PM - Advaith Jayakumar: It's one syllable, I believe

6/19/18, 3:51 PM - Akhil Ashok: It would help if you speak
6/19/18, 3:51 PM - Advaith Jayakumar: Be llo and el bow are interchanging only their first syllable da
6/19/18, 3:51 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: First syllable?
6/19/18, 3:51 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: Be is one syllable
6/19/18, 3:51 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: llo is another
6/19/18, 3:51 PM - Advaith Jayakumar: So is ell
6/19/18, 3:52 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: So what "first syllable" are they interchanging?
6/19/18, 3:52 PM - Advaith Jayakumar: Bellow = be + low
Elbow = el + bow
6/19/18, 3:52 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: When there are only two syllables?
6/19/18, 3:52 PM - ‚Ä™+91 91087 91307‚Ä¨: Sounds better when said out loud, but I'm still wondering if it's technically allowed

6/19/18, 3:53 PM - ‚Ä™+91 98404 02685‚Ä¨: First sounds/letters interchanged is allowed

6/19/18, 3:53 PM - Sachin Sridhar: Syllabification depends on your convention of which consonant group binds to which vowels (before vs after). Afaik both are legit
6/19/18, 3:53 PM - Advaith Jayakumar: Inga more than that da
6/19/18, 3:53 PM - Advaith Jayakumar: Bellow is split into bel+ow I guess
6/19/18, 3:54 PM - Advaith Jayakumar: And elbow is split into elb+ow

6/19/18, 9:54 PM - Crossie Bot: *Crossie bot help*

Hi there, this is crossie bot! I keep track of the clues posted on this group, but I can also do a few others things.

All clues from this group (and older ones) are archived at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n1fAjkz6VnBuTZNX1Hh9zQZhKoblquf-FBxOTuIgs1o/edit#gid=0 (editable sheet). If you do not find your clue there within a day of posting, be sure to ask Sachin about it.

*Messages I respond to (case insensitive)*

@919008433618 how2
_I display this help message._

@919008433618 but why
_I send a link to a YouTube video._

@(phone number) RTS
_I give away an RTS! For further information on RTS, ask Rakesh._

@919008433618 RTS tally
_I display the current RTS tally._

*FAQs*

How do you know know when a message is a clue?

_I look for text followed by numbers enclosed in (parantheses). Multiple clues in a single message is fine too. Anything after the enum of the last clue in a message is ignored. Clues that span multiple lines are currently unsupported and will not be archived._

Why aren't you working fine?

_Usually the most likely reason is that there's a power or internet outage here. Response times should typically be 5 seconds or less, so don't bother waiting for me. You can blame Sachin, he keeps tinkering with me._

6/30/18, 7:17 PM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: One is brute force... each of you solve whatever clues you know in the sheet the bot is compiling
6/30/18, 7:17 PM - Kumaresh Ramakrishnan: Any other more efficient way? Ideas?

6/30/18, 7:25 PM - Crossie Bot: *Crossie bot help*

Hi there, this is crossie bot! I keep track of the clues posted on this group, but I can also do a few others things.

All clues from this group (and older ones) are archived at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n1fAjkz6VnBuTZNX1Hh9zQZhKoblquf-FBxOTuIgs1o/edit#gid=0 (editable sheet). If you do not find your clue there within a day of posting, be sure to ask Sachin about it.

*Messages I respond to (case insensitive)*

@919008433618 how2
_I display this help message._

But why
_I send a link to a YouTube video._

@(phone number) RTS
_I give away an RTS! For further information on RTS, ask Rakesh._

@919008433618 RTS tally
_I display the current RTS tally._

*FAQs*

How do you know know when a message is a clue?

_I look for text followed by numbers enclosed in (parantheses). Multiple clues in a single message is fine too. Anything after the enum of the last clue in a message is ignored. Clues that span multiple lines are currently unsupported and will not be archived._

Why aren't you working fine?

_Usually the most likely reason is that there's a power or internet outage here. Response times should typically be 5 seconds or less, so don't bother waiting for me. You can blame Sachin, he keeps tinkering with me._

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WMd7kVnGJypUmbnlir9_wh3XH0_Osb9PPh5m7mknJoQ/edit?usp=sharing

This is a *different sheet*. It's *stable*, meaning that the bot *will not* touch it and all edits are by humans only. You can modify surfaces, delete duplicates, etc on this sheet. The reason for creating this copy is that (1) the order of clues can potentially change on the other sheet (blame the bot) so it doesn't make sense answering clues there (2) Surface upgrades are possible, duplicate clues, {Ferril's [annos (like)] (these)} and other spam is removed, allowing for a cleaner list overall.

@919789855067 , @919940071023 and I have been answering whatever we can, and we'd love to have a repository of clues. If you remember the answer to any clues on the sheet, go ahead and fill them in.
