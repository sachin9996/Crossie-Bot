6/4/15, 10:29 PM - Ferril Samal: The son of an impoverished Bedouin goat herder, Gaddafi became involved in politics while at school in Sabha, subsequently enrolling in the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi. Founding a revolutionary cell within the military, in 1969 they seized power from the monarchy of King Idris in abloodless coup. Becoming Chairman of the governing Revolutionary Command Council(RCC), Gaddafi abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the Republic. Ruling by decree, he implemented measures to remove what he viewed as foreign imperialist influence from Libya, and strengthened ties to Arab nationalist governments. Intent on pushing Libya towards "Islamic socialism", he introduced sharia as the basis for the legal system and nationalized the oil industry, using the increased revenues to bolster the military, implement social programs and fund revolutionary militants across the world. In 1973 he initiated a "Popular Revolution" with the formation of General People's Committees (GPCs), purported to be a system of direct democracy, but retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International Theory that year, publishing these ideas in The Green Book.

6/14/15, 1:17 PM - Ananth Sundararaman: Nice round from a quiz. Can pass it of as cryptic in a way..
So- the theme is movie name. Adding the suffix "-ing" to the movie name will give you the verb for describing a phrase; the aim is to guess the movie name.

Eg:
Phrase: "Wood dust from wood cutting and chopping."

Ans : "saw"ing
6/14/15, 1:19 PM - Ananth Sundararaman: Make sense?

6/20/15, 10:54 PM - ‪+91 91768 27012‬: Once upon a time, there was a man. His name was Michelangelo. His parents named him after the great Renaissance artist and sculptor because of their dream that their son will one day be great artist. However, as Michelangelo grew up, he developed an interest in medicine, and even made the dastardly choice of taking up Biology in his 11th and 12th. He loved medicine and biology so much that his teacher had to ask him to unlearn all the things he knew so he would be at the same level as the class. 
However he, being a future doctor, had no artistic talent whatsoever. He didn't know what was aesthetically pleasing, and what was not. Hell, he didn't even know how to spell 'aesthetically'. He once had to write down the word 'aesthetically', but not one soul could read it. But that was not on account of his spelling, but because all doctors' handwriting is illegible. 
His parents realised that their child, on whom they pinned their ambitions on, couldn't draw or paint to save his life. They were extremely disappointed and disowned Michelangelo. Michelangelo, the young adult that he was, disowned them right back and left home. 
Living life all alone under a bridge, he began to feel lonely. He had no friends or family. He began to feel the burden of living alone, with no love or care. He also began to feel ashamed that he let his parents down. Alas, if only he could paint or draw. He tried and tried to learn the art, and after 17 long years, he drew two hills and a river. He stood back and was proud of himself, but a passing-by hobo looked at it and said "Nice camel you drew there, kid."
Michelangelo realised he would never be able to draw. He would never be what his parents wanted him to be. Michelangelo, overcome with grief, took his life by eating all the paint he could find. 

Michelangelo's body lay under that bridge he called home for so long that all but the bones had vanished. But it can be safely said that even Michalengelo's bones had better Paint skills than Rakesh Vkr.
